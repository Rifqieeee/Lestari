## Architecture
Model View Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern in creating an application by separating the code into three parts consisting of:

- Model
The part in charge of preparing, managing, manipulating, and organizing data in the database.

- View
The part in charge of displaying information in the form of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

- Controller
The part in charge of connecting and organizing models and views so that they can be connected to each other.
